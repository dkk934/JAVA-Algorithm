## Installation 🛠️
Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dkk934/JAVA-Algorithm.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd JAVA-Algorithm
    ```
3. **Compile the Java files:**
   - Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from the official [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) page.
   - Compile all source files:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin Graphs/*.java Sorting/*.java Trees/*.java CPMathAlgorithms/*.java MaximumFlow/*.java MinimumSpanningTree/*.java Searching/*.java ShortestPath/*.java UserInterface/*.java
    ```
   - This command compiles all Java files in the project and places the compiled classes in the `bin` directory.

## Usage 🎯
Want to see the algorithms in action? Here's how:

1. **Navigate to the `bin` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd bin
    ```
2. **Run a program:**
   - To execute the **User Interface**, run:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
   - You can also run individual algorithms by specifying the respective class name.

## Included Algorithms 📂
This project includes implementations of various algorithms categorized as follows:

### 🔹 Graphs
Algorithms for traversing and searching graphs, crucial for modeling relationships in networks and connections.

### 🔹 Sorting
Techniques to arrange data in a specific order (ascending/descending), with different sorting methods optimized for various use cases.

### 🔹 Trees
Operations on tree data structures like binary search trees, including insertion, deletion, and traversal algorithms.

### 🔹 Shortest Path
Algorithms to find the optimal route between nodes in a graph with minimal cost, distance, or time.

### 🔹 Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Techniques for finding a subset of edges in a weighted graph that connects all vertices with the lowest total edge weight.

### 🔹 Maximum Flow
Methods to determine the greatest amount of flow possible from a source node to a sink node in a flow network.
